.Sh DESCRIPTION
pstree shows running processes as a tree. The tree is rooted at either pid or init if pid is omitted. If a user name is specified, all process trees rooted at processes owned by that user are shown.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a, -arguments
Show command line arguments.
.It Fl -colorize
Colorize the pstree output. This option is only visible in the help if your terminal supports color.
.It Fl c, -color
Color the process name by given attribute. Currently pstree accepts the values age, cpu, and me. With age, processes newer than 60 seconds are green, newer than an hour yellow, and the remaining are red. With cpu, processes using less than 5% CPU are green, greater than 5% and less than 15% are yellow, and the remaining are red. With mem, processes using less than 10% memory are green, greater than 10% and less than 20% are yellow, and the remaining are red. 
.It Fl s, -contains
Show only branches containing process with <string> in commandline.
.It Fl c, -cpu
Show the CPU utilization for each process in the list using the format (c: 0.00%).
.It Fl U, -exclude-root
Don't show branches containing only root processes. This cannot be used with --user.
.It Fl l, -level
Limit the output the number of levels specified.
.It Fl m, -memory
Show the memory usage for each process in the list using the format (m: 0.00 MiB).
.It Fl g, -mode
Use graphics chars for tree. n=1: IBM-850, n=2: VT100, n=3: UTF-8
.It Fl n, -no-pids
Suppress displaying the PID with each process.
.It Fl p, -pid
Show only branches containing process <PID>.
.It Fl -rainbow
Display the output in a really annoying rainbow pattern. You've been warned.
.It Fl t, -threads
Show the number of threads for each process in the list using the format (t: xx).
.It Fl u, -user
Show only branches containing processes of <user>. This cannot be used with --exclude-root.
