.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pstree
shows running processes as a tree. The tree is rooted at launchd. If --pid is specified, the tree will be rooted at the specified PID. If --user is specified, all process trees rooted at processes owned by that user are shown.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \--age
Show the age of each process in the list using the format (dd:hh:mm:ss).
.TP
.B \--all
Equivalent to -a --age -c -g -m -t
.TP
.B \-a, \--arguments
Show command line arguments after the process name.
.TP
.B \-C, \--color \fIattribute\fR
Color the process name by given attribute. Currently pstree accepts the values \fBage\fR, \fBcpu\fR, and \fBmem\fR. With \fBage\fR, processes newer than 60 seconds are green, newer than an hour are yellow, and the remaining are red. With \fBcpu\fR, processes using less than 5% CPU are green, greater than 5% and less than 15% are yellow, and the remaining are red. With \fBmem\fR, processes using less than 10% memory are green, greater than 10% and less than 20% are yellow, and the remaining are red. This option cannot be used with either \fB--colorize\fR or \fB--rainbow\fR. The field for the specified attribute will automatically be enabled in the process list. In other words, \fBpstree -C age\fR implies \fB--age\fR.
.TP
.B --colorize
Colorize the pstree output. This option is only visible in the help if your terminal supports color. This option is not available if your terminal doesn't support at least 8 color output. This option cannot be used with either \fB--color\fR or \fB--rainbow\fR.
.TP
.B \-s, \--contains \fIpattern\fR
Show only branches containing processes with \fIpattern\fR in the command line.
.TP
.B \-c, \--cpu
Show the CPU utilization for each process in the list using the format (c:0.00%).
.TP
.B \-U, \--exclude-root
Don't show branches containing only root processes. This option cannot be used with \fB--user\fR.
.TP
.B \-h, \--help
Display a help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-i, \--ibm-850
Use IBM-850 line drawing characters.
.TP
.B \-l, \--level \fIlevel\fR
Traverse the tree \fIlevel\fR levels deep.
.TP
.B \-m, \--memory
Show the memory usage for each process in the list using the format (m:0.00 MiB).
.TP
.B \--no-pids
Do not show process IDs.
.TP
.B \-o, \--order-by \fIfield\fR
Sort processes by a given field. Available options are: age, cpu, mem, pid, threads, user.
.TP
.B \-g, \--pgid
Show PGIDs. Process Group IDs are shown as decimal numbers after each process ID.
.TP
.B \-p, \--pid \fIPID\fR
Show only branches containing process \fIPID\fR.
.TP
.B --rainbow
Colorize the 
Display the output in a really annoying rainbow pattern. You've been warned. This option is not available if your terminal doesn't support 256 color output. This option cannot be used with either \fB--color\fR or \fB--colorize\fR.
.TP
.B \-t, \--threads
Show the number of threads for each process in the list using the format (t:xx).
.TP
.B \--user \fIuser\fR
If this option is used, all process trees rooted at processes owned by \fIuser\fR are shown. This option can be used muiltiple times and cannot be used with \fB--exclude-root\fR.
.TP
.B \-u, \--utf-8
Use UTF-8 (Unicode) line drawing characters.
.TP
.B \-v, \--vt-100
Use VT-100 (Unicode) line drawing characters.
.TP
.B \-V, \--version
Display version information.
.TP
.B \-w, \--wide
Display long lines. By default, lines are truncated to either the COLUMNS environment variable or the display width. If neither of these methods work, the default of 132 columns is used.
.SH EXAMPLES
To display help:
.PP
.EX
pstree --help
.EE

Show processes owned by \fBbob\fR and \fBfred\fR and also display their command line arguments:
.PP
.EX
pstree --user bob --user fred -a
.EE

Show the process group ID, command line arguments, use a wide format, and use UTF-8 graphics:
.PP
.EX
pstree -g -a -w -u
.EE
