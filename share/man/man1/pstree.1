.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pstree
shows running processes as a tree. The tree is rooted at launchd. If \fB--pid\fR is specified, the tree will be rooted at the specified PID. If \fB--user\fR is specified, all process trees rooted at processes owned by that user are shown. By default, processes are grouped and collapsed by command name and arguments. This can be disabled with the \fB--compact-not\fR option. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a, \--arguments
Show command line arguments after the process name.
.TP
.B \-A, \--all
Equivalent to -a -c -g -G -m -O -p -t -I. This option cannot be used with \fB--uid-transitions\fR or \fB--user-transitions\fR.
.TP
.B \-c, \--cpu
Show the CPU utilization for each process in the list using the format (c:0.00%). This option implies \fB--compact-not\fR, since some of the results may be buried in collapsed subtrees.
.TP
.B \-C, \--colorize
Colorize the pstree output. This option is only visible in the help if your terminal supports color. This option is not available if your terminal doesn't support at least 8 color output. This option cannot be used with \fB--color\fR or \fB--rainbow\fR.
.TP
.B \-d, \--debug
Show debugging data. This option is only available to specific users.
.TP
.B \-g, \--pgid
Show PGIDs. Process Group IDs are shown as decimal numbers in parentheses after each process name.
.TP
.B \-G, \--age
Show the age of each process in the list using the format (dd:hh:mm:ss).
.TP
.B \-h, \--help
Display a help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-H, \--hide-threads
Hide threads, showing only processes. When this option is used, threads will not be displayed in the process tree and thread information will be omitted from compact mode output. Thread counts will still be shown if the -t option is used.
.TP
.B \-i, \--ibm-850
Use IBM-850 line drawing characters.
.TP
.B \-I, \--uid-transitions
Show processes where the user ID changes from the parent process, e.g., (uid\[u2192]uid). This makes it easy to identify privilege escalations or drops in the process tree. This option cannot be used with \fB--user-transitions\fR.
.TP
.B \-k, \--color \fIattr\fR
Color the process name by the given attribute. Valid options are: age, cpu, mem. This option is not available if your terminal doesn't support at least 8 color output. This option implies \fB--compact-not\fR, since some of the offenders may be buried in collapsed subtrees. This option cannot be used with \fB--colorize\fR or \fB--rainbow\fR.
.TP
.B \-l, \--level \fIlevel\fR
Print tree to \fIlevel\fR level deep.
.TP
.B \-m, \--memory
Show the memory usage for each process in the list using the format (m:0.00 MiB). This option implies \fB--compact-not\fR, since some of the results may be buried in collapsed subtrees.
.TP
.B \-n, \--compact-not
Do not compact identical subtrees in output. By default, identical process subtrees are shown only once with a count indicating how many instances exist (e.g., "process---N*[process]"). This option disables compaction, showing each process individually.
.TP
.B \-o, \--order-by \fIfield\fR
Sort processes by a given field. Available options are: age, cpu, mem, pid, threads, user.
.TP
.B \-O, \--show-owner
Show the owner of the process.
.TP
.B \-p, \--show-pids
Show PIDs. Process IDs are shown as decimal numbers in parentheses after each process name.
.TP
.B \-P, \--pid \fIPID\fR
Show only branches containing process \fIPID\fR.
.TP
.B \-r, \--rainbow
Display the output in a really annoying rainbow pattern. You've been warned. This option is not available if your terminal doesn't support 256 color output. This option cannot be used with \fB--color\fR or \fB--colorize\fR.
.TP
.B \-s, \--contains \fIpattern\fR
Show only branches containing processes with \fIpattern\fR in the command line. This option implies \fB--compact-not\fR, since some of the results may be buried in collapsed subtrees.
.TP
.B \-S, \--show-pgls
Show process group leader indicators. By default, process group leaders are not marked with special characters in the output.
.TP
.B \-t, \--threads
Show the number of threads for each process in the list using the format (t:xx).
.TP
.B \-u, \--utf-8
Use UTF-8 (Unicode) line drawing characters.
.TP
.B \-U, \--user-transitions
Show processes where the username changes from the parent process, e.g., (user\[u2192]user). This makes it easy to identify privilege escalations or drops in the process tree. This option cannot be used with \fB--uid-transitions\fR or \fB--all\fR.
.TP
.B \--user \fIuser\fR
Show only branches containing processes of \fIuser\fR. This option can be used more than once. This option cannot be used with \fB--exclude-root\fR.
.TP
.B \-v, \--vt-100
Use VT-100 line drawing characters.
.TP
.B \-V, \--version
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.B \-w, \--wide
Do not truncate output to the width of the screen.
.TP
.B \-X, \--exclude-root
Don't show branches containing only root processes. This option cannot be used with \fB--user\fR.
